# Hugo Video Starter

Out of the box, Hugo has support for Youtube and Vimeo, but lacks the support for the media coming from any other resources. This is a starter for using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with various media files from various resources. It is using [Clappr](https://github.com/clappr/clappr).

This site is using [Victor Hugo](https://github.com/netlify-templates/victor-hugo). It is a Hugo boilerplate for creating truly epic websites.
